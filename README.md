# Connect-Four

This connect four game was started while completing freeCodeCamp's "Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games."
Expanding on the provided code, I added a feature that shows a grey circle when hovering over a valid next move for the current player. 
I've also found a bug where a space with the class 'player-one' can be overwritted by during player-two's turn. 
My next step is to resolve this issue as well as to add more styling to the game.
